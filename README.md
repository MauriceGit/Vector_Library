# Vector Library

This is a simple to use vector library containing most basic vector operations.

It is completely standalone and does not require any other libraries.

Please see the **mtVector.h** for function headers. The function names should be
self explanatory. If you are not clear about a function, see the **mtVector.c**
for a more detailed explanation of what is done.
